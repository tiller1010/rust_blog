## Consistentcy is key
A user that consistently uses your app is more likely to become a loyal customer. This is especially true for language learning apps. A consistent learner is more likely to learn the language.

## Use a streak system
A streak system is a great way to encourage consistent use of your app. It's a simple way to reward users for using your app every day. It's also a great way to show users their progress.

Duolingo for iPhone features an optional widget the gradually dims throughout the day. This creates a sense of urgency for the user to complete their daily goal.

## Allow learners to encourage each other
Duolingo features a "Friends Quest" feature, in which users complete a challenge together. This is a great way to encourage users to use the app consistently by having users encourage one another.

## Send reminders
Sending reminders is a great way to encourage users to use your app consistently. User's should have the option to opt out of reminders, however. There should be a prompt to select the level of notifications to receive when first installing the app or creating an account.
