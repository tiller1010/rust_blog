# Using a second language at an airport

One place that a second language is most useful is at an airport. Whether you are dealing with security, interacting with other flyers, or listening to announcements, knowing a second language can be a huge advantage. Here are some things to keep in mind and useful tips for using a second language at an airport.

## Security

When going through security, it is important to understand the instructions given by security personnel. If you are in a foreign country, the security personnel may not speak your native language. Knowing a second language can help you understand the instructions and move through security more quickly.

Phrases such as "I don't speak [language]" or "Can you speak more slowly?" can be useful when interacting with security personnel. It is also helpful to know basic security-related vocabulary in the language you are learning.

## Interacting with other flyers

You may accidentally bump into someone or need to ask for directions while at the airport. Knowing someone else's language can turn an otherwise awkward situation into a friendly interaction.

If you are not as confident in your language skills, you could eavesdrop on conversations around you. When sitting at the gate, listen to the announcements and conversations happening around you. This can help you pick up on common phrases and vocabulary that you may need to use.

## Listening to announcements

If you are in a foreign country, the announcements may not be in English. Knowing the language of the country you are in can help you understand important announcements. This is especially important if there are gate changes or delays.

## Ordering food or shopping

Many airports have restaurants and shops where you can order food or buy souvenirs. Attempt to order in the language you are learning. This can be a great way to practice your language skills in a low-pressure environment.
