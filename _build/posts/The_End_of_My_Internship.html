<h1>The End of My Internship</h1>
<p>In May of this year, I got my first web development Internship. It has been a twelve week program at Werkbot Studios, right in downtown Erie. During this time, I took time off from work so I could continue to my self-education in my spare time. This gave me much more flexibility to practice and learn. I was able to be especially productive with my time Werkbot. I have practiced soft skills such as writing or fixing documentation, sharing ideas, and public speaking. Plus, I have even been able to take on some work of my own!</p>

<p>A lot of my recent training has been focused on SilverStripe, which is a CMS that, on the surface, looks similar to WordPress. SilverStripe, however, is not just a CMS but also an MVC framework. It is not as simple as editing a theme and installing a few plugins. SilverStripe is largely based around having classes represent page types and having those classes provide fields for the CMS. Templates will then &quot;listen&quot; to the data entered in said fields. SilverStripe is centered around PHP, and despite criticism, I find PHP to be both powerful and readable. A majority of complaints come from the &quot;legacy PHP&quot; stigma that suggests the language is inconsistent with itself. It can be true in a sense, but just remember that most version differences can be found in the documentation. This remains true for SilverStripe, as most questions are answered by the project's contributors. Learning SilverStripe has taught me how to create dynamic websites with an easy to use CMS, and I am interested in using it for my own projects.</p>

<p>Alongside learning a framework/CMS, I have also been able to pick up on a few soft skills. During my internship, I have had one or more developers available to learn from and to review my code. Whenever I have questions, I can reach out to someone on Slack or leave a comment on a pull request. I have been told it is a good idea to be as descriptive as possible, so that other developers can understand my thought process. Doing so makes it easier to solve problems and helps to improve my communication. I also get to participate in both staff and developer meetings. Here, I get to share my ideas and recent progress, as well as watch how others communicate. The internship has helped me become more confidant when speaking in front of other people.</p>

<p>In addition to the practice I get at Werkbot, I have also developed my communication skills outside of the office. I recently gave a talk at the Coderie Meetup group about my experiences. The idea was given to me by a member of Werkbot. It went very well, and I even wrote a brief blog post about the experience <a href="https://tylertroutblog.com/presentation-was-a-success/">here</a>. Public speaking also helps improve my ability to talk to clients. I have had a few face to face meetings with small business owners who are looking for their own website. In these meetings, I have been able to showcase what I have been working on, as well as receive feedback to move forward with. Not everyone has met with me in person, though I have finished websites for both clients that I met online exclusively and for those I met in person.</p>
<p>During my internship at Werkbot, my skills as a developer have improved greatly. I am able to use SilverStripe to create dynamic websites. I practiced my communication with other developers, staff, and clients. Lastly, I took what I learned, and I applied it to my own work. With no school experience, I feel privileged to have had this opportunity, and it has been an awesome adventure.</p>
